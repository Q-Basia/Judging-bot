# Judging-bot

This bot was created and utilized in the 2023 HackED hackathon hosted by the Computer Engineering Club at the University Of Alberta.

It was utilized during the judging period of the 24 event by by judges and organizers to make the judging experience smooth and fast. I created this bot because the last hackathon I organized, HackED Beta, we were very disorganized and stressed during the judging period as some of the approximately 200 students would not answer us or would opt out of judging last second. How much more stressful would it be to handle a hackathopn with over 500 participants?

So to solve my problem, I created this bot to help order all the participants that have opted their project for judging and call the next person with different commands. I made it so that the using one list, didferent grups of judges can call the next person in line when they are available, which make the judging faster. 
In the case of this hybrid hackathon, I built it so that participants have the option to present their projects either in-person or online. 

To use this bot succesfully, the server requires having 2 roles:
online
in-person

To have your own bot use this code follow the discord developer panel info on how to create a bot. Please note you will need to replace the TOKEN value with your bots unique token.
